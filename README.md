A set of plugins that will bring the power of ToxicLIbs, Boost Voronoi and other geometric libraries to Blender.

I have not yet uploaded:
* the blender plugins
* c++ boost code (jni library)
* google protocol buffer code (will likely be a fork)
* updated ToxicLibs library  (will likely be a fork)

So none of the plugins are usable yet
